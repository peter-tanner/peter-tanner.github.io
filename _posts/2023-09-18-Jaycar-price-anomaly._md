This has to be the first time I've seen a product on Jaycar be cheaper than, well, literally anywhere else.

| Jaycar                                                                                             | Amazon                                                                |

Can't find anything below $20 on Amazon. Although, to be fair the Jaycar one does look like an older model, so maybe paying the ~$2 difference for the newer ones will be worth it anyways.
