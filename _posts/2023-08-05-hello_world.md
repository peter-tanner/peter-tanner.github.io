Welcome to my blog, about time I got one of these since there's a lot of random thoughts and technical experiences I have that might be useful. **The legacy site is still available if you want to see that crap at https://peter-tanner.github.com/legacy_site**

The site is using the [chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) theme, which I chose due to it's good use of screen space.

```c
int main(void) {
	printf("hello world!");
}
```
