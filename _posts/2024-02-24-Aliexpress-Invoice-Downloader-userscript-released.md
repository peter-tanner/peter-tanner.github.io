I've just released a new userscript to allow you to bulk download invoices from the Aliexpress order page (https://www.aliexpress.com/p/order/index.html) in one click. Normally, you need to open the order details for each item then click another button to open the invoice PDF, then save it. This extension replaces this process with one click to download the invoice. A bulk download button is also added to allow you to download the invoices for all of the visible orders in the order page.

**Get the userscript on [GitHub](https://github.com/peter-tanner/AliExpress-Invoice-Downloader) or [greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/488177-aliexpress-invoice-downloader).**

I made this userscript since for reimbursements at university need invoices, and Aliexpress generates an invoice for each seller and does not consolidate them all into one, so it is very annoying for me to get reimbursed since I tend to order from different sellers.
