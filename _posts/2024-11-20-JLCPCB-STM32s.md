My objective was to find an STM32 with the following features:

- SDIO
- USB
- CAN
- 48 or 64 pins

And standard features such as SPI and UART.

Here are some STM32s which fit these capabilities and are available on JLCPCB, along with some other honorable mentions.

Feel free to comment below your favorite MCUs on JLCPCB, I'm interested in hearing about it (especially if you have one that does BLE, CAN, SDIO, USB and has more IO than an ESP32-S3 and less power consumption).
