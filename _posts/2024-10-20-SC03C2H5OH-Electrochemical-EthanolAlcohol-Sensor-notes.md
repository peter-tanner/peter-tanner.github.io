Most alcohol sensor modules use the MQ3 alcohol sensor (or similar), which operate using a metal oxide semiconductor which changes in resistivity when alcohol is exposed to it. These tend to be terrible. The SC03-C2H5OH is the cheapest electrochemical alcohol sensor I could find online, it uses an electrochemical cell which should be better.

I was able to purchase it in quantities of one on [Aliexpress](item/1005005789802562.html) for around $20 AUD. The package arrived with the sensor and a male-male ribbon cable to connect it to a 2.0 mm picoblade connector (see below for specifications).

## Better datasheet

If you email the company listed on the Aliexpress page you will get a datasheet, but it is quite unreadable. It appears this datasheet has been copy and pasted from other similar gas sensors since the commands used to communicate are the same. The datasheet is missing some commands present on other gas sensors (like putting the sensor into polling mode).

| --------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 9600 baud | 8         | 1        | None       |

#### Checksum calculation

```c
unsigned char get_checksum(unsigned char array[], unsigned char array_size)
{
    unsigned char checksum = 0;
    for (unsigned char i = 1; i < array_size - 2; i++)
        checksum += array[i];
    checksum = (~checksum) + 1;
    return checksum;
}
```

### Important notes

1. Electrolyte leakage may cause damage; do not disassemble the sensor.
2. Avoid exposing the sensor to organic solvents (including silicone rubber, adhesives), coatings, pharmaceuticals, oils, or high-concentration gases.
3. Electrochemical sensors should not be fully encapsulated in resin or placed in oxygen-free environments, as this will damage the sensor and affect its performance.
4. Do not use electrochemical sensors in environments with corrosive gases for extended periods, as these gases can damage the sensors.
5. Gas zero-point measurements must be conducted in a clean atmosphere.
6. When testing or using the sensor, avoid direct vertical air intake from the front.
7. Do not block or contaminate the air inlet surface of the sensor.
8. Do not open or damage the waterproof and breathable membrane on the sensor.
9. The sensor must not be subjected to excessive shock or vibration.
10. Do not use the sensor if the casing is damaged or deformed.
11. After prolonged exposure to high-concentration gases, the sensor will recover slowly to its original state.
12. During storage, the anode and cathode should remain short-circuited.
13. Do not encapsulate the sensor using hot melt adhesive or sealant that cures at temperatures above 80Â Â°C.
14. Avoid storing or using the sensor in high-concentration alkaline gas for extended periods.

## Reverse engineering

This configuration appears to be copy-pasted between a lot of these gas sensors on Alibaba/Aliexpress. The commands/output data format are also the same between most of these sensors. The PCB layouts are also very similar, but sometimes differ for some reason. For example, the picoblade connector is sometimes omitted, and others use 2.54 mm headers instead of the 2.00 mm headers on this sensor.

It may be programmed over SWD interface through the 2.00 mm headers.
