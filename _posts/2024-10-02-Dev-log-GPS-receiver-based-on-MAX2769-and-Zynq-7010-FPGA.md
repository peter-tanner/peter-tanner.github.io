## Datasheet

> The MAX2769B features an on-chip ADC to digitize the
> downconverted GPS signal. The maximum sampling
> rate of the ADC is approximately 50Msps. The sampled
> output is provided in a **2-bit format (1-bit magnitude and
> 1-bit sign) by default** and also can be configured as a
> **1-bit or 2-bit** in both I and Q channels, or 1-bit, 2-bit, or
> 3-bit in the I channel only. The ADC supports the digital
> outputs in three different formats: the unsigned binary,
> the sign and magnitude, or the twoâ€™s complement format
> by setting bits FORMAT in Configuration register 2. MSB
> bits are output at I1 or Q1 pins and LSB bits are output at
> I0 or Q0 pins, for I or Q channel, respectively. In the case
> of 3-bit, output data format is selected in the I channel
> only, the MSB is output at I1, the second bit is at I0, and
> the LSB is at Q1.

Surely two-bit correlation is the same process, just with more precision because of the additional bit?
