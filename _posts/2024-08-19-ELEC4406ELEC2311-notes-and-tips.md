## Issues with saving file/modifying files not updating the simulation

The optimizer is once again causing issues.

My recommendation is to use `qrun` and do things in the terminal with `assert`s instead of trying to do it graphically using the verification diagrams. It also is much quicker.

For some reason, I can't get incremental compilation working and it just causes more issuse than the time it saves right now, since it results in changes not affecting the simulation, so for now I am cleanly rebuilding each simulation.

In GUI mode, manually start the simulation. When you need to update the simulation run this commandline

<!--
```bash
qrun $FILE_NAME -optimize -cleanlib -top $TOP_LEVEL_ENTITY; restart -force; run -all
``` -->

```bash
vcom *.vhd; restart -force; run -all
```

Here's also how to run the simulation in headless mode from a commandline (Do not run from Questa GUI, since it will make Questa quit)

```bash
qrun $FILE_NAME -optimize -simulate -cleanlib -top $TOP_LEVEL_ENTITY
```

## No objects appearing in modelsim/questa for testbenches

âš  TODO: Fix previous issue in GUI as well (I am now using qrun instead of the GUI).

This is because the signals are being optimized out since they aren't really used for anything useful.

The intel questa/modelsim version shipped with the unit is 18.1, but this allowed vopt to be disabled. This is no longer the case on the latest versions of intel questa (You will get a compile error if you disable vopt flow).

Go to `Simulate > Start Simulation...`, ensure optimization is enabled then click on `Optimization Options...`

Then select `Apply full visibility to all modules(full debug mode)` and press `OK`.

## Dark mode in intel quartus

Run this script I made on windows. [ðŸ”—Link](https://github.com/peter-tanner/Intel-Quartus-Dark-Mode-Windows)

## Test 1

### Types

- structual modelling => describe connections between entities using `port map`
- dataflow modelling => concurrent execution of statements

```vhdl
A<=B;
C<=A;
...
```

- behavioral modelling => sequential execution

###

- Signals - signals are only mutated when the process finishes.
- Variables - variables are mutated at each statement in the process.

### Evaluation of process manually

- Double-check at end of first execution the sensitivity list to see if anything changes again

### Delay

Look at Expr evaluation value to decide if change should be rejected (not inputs)

- Transport `O <= TRANSPORT Expr AFTER 10 ns;`
- Inertial `O <= REJECT 10 ns INERTIAL Expr AFTER 10 ns;`
- Inertial `O <= Expr AFTER 10 ns;` (Inertial delay: `10 ns`, same as transport component)
- Delta time `O <= Expr` (Implicit - delta time is applied to concurrent statements when a statement is dependent on the output of a previous one. Expressions which can be executed concurrently have the same delta time)

Make table like this for delta time (required for followthrough marks):

| Time  | Event | Processes triggered | Transactions enqueued | Causes event? |
| ----- | ----- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| 5 ns  | E->1  | U1                  | 10ns:E->0             | Y             |
| 10 ns | E->0  | U1                  | 15ns:E->1             | Y             |
| ...   | ...   | ...                 | ...                   | ...           |

### CHECKLIST

- Check for statements where inputs are assigned to or outputs are read from
  - Use signals instead
- Do not include data in sensitivity list for flip flops.
- Process: only use tokens with `sequential-statement` (`when` is not sequential)

## Lab quick reference

Tip: when using pin planner, you can copy paste multiple selections if you are using vscode multi cursors and copying from the markdown version of this page. Useful for filling out seven segment displays.
